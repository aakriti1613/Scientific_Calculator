# Scientific_Calculator
This project is a fully functional **scientific calculator** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Bootstrap**, and **JavaScript**. The calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations as well as advanced scientific calculations, including trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentiation, and more. It offers a sleek, responsive user interface that allows for easy navigation and input, ensuring a seamless user experience for both mobile and desktop devices.

FEATURES
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Scientific Functions:** 
  - Trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, and their inverses).
  - Logarithmic functions (`log`, `ln`).
  - Exponentiation (`X^Y`, `10^X`, `e^X`).
  - Square root, cube root, and factorial.
  - Degree and Radian modes for trigonometric operations.
- **Keyboard and Click Support:** Users can either type or click buttons for input.
- **Error Handling:** Proper error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero, negative roots).
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts automatically for different screen sizes, making it accessible on both mobile and desktop devices.
